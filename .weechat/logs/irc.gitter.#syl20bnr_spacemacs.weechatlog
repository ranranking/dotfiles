2016-03-26 14:29:54	mark-otaris	Oh, however it's not with Emacs 25.0, so I should mention that in the issue

2016-03-26 14:39:26	mark-otaris	it seems the same is happening in this Debian container with Emacs 24.4
2016-03-26 14:41:21	travisbhartwell	Yeah, that happens every so often
2016-03-26 14:42:00	mark-otaris	https://clbin.com/Fk4ibc.png
2016-03-26 14:42:50	mark-otaris	I can't tell what it's related to, but in any case it happens both on my Fedora install with Emacs 24.5 and in a clean Debian container with Emacs 24.4, so I see no way it could be related to my configuration
2016-03-26 14:44:22	mark-otaris	oh
2016-03-26 14:44:26	mark-otaris	melpa.org gets a SERVFAIL with dig
2016-03-26 14:44:44	mark-otaris	awesome, I know how to fix this
2016-03-26 14:45:47	mark-otaris	org-mode.org, elpa.gnu.org and melpa.org all have DNSSEC?
2016-03-26 14:45:48	bsteindorf	i want to write a mode for a custom scripting language i found out how, but what is the correct way in spacemacs? is it `<SPC> : configuration-layer/create-layer RET` ?
2016-03-26 14:46:01	mark-otaris	this is what happens when a Tor exit node's ISP messes with DNS
2016-03-26 14:47:08	mark-otaris	@mark-otaris restarts Emacs
2016-03-26 14:47:17	mark-otaris	everything works as expecte—or not...
2016-03-26 14:47:27	mark-otaris	—or yes
2016-03-26 14:49:32	mark-otaris	NJBS: I found the solution to the problem
2016-03-26 14:52:28	NJBS	@mark-otaris :thumbsup: Could you maybe add your experience to that issue in case someone sees it in the same situation?
2016-03-26 14:52:53	mark-otaris	NJBS: well, in the same situation...
2016-03-26 14:53:59	mark-otaris	I have my system set up to make all outgoing connections go through the Tor network. One of the exit nodes has an ISP that messes with DNS records. I also have dnssec-triggerd set up with a local Unbound DNS resolver which validates DNSSEC-signed records. By messing with the DNS records, that ISP makes the signatures invalid and thus Unbound gives a SERVFAIL when trying to resolve those 
2016-03-26 14:54:00	mark-otaris	domains.
2016-03-26 14:54:13	mark-otaris	It turns out melpa.org, elpa.gnu.org and org-mode.org have DNSSEC (how they all come to have it I don't know)
2016-03-26 14:54:29	mark-otaris	so they got a SERVFAIL and weren't able to resolve, and thus of course Emacs wasn't able to connect to them and download packages
2016-03-26 14:55:34	mark-otaris	the solution in my case was to run tor-resolve melpa.org, tor-resolve elpa.gnu.org, tor-resolve elpa.org-mode.org and to add the IP addresses with the domain names to /etc/hosts
2016-03-26 14:56:09	mark-otaris	and since the container was running on the Fedora system, it used the local DNS resolver as well and had the same problem
2016-03-26 14:57:13	travisbhartwell	Sounds overly complicated :)
2016-03-26 14:57:29	mark-otaris	It is, I doubt anyone else is ever going to get this issue.
2016-03-26 14:58:36	mark-otaris	that said I have another issue now... https://clbin.com/WG2Nyb.png
2016-03-26 14:59:13	NJBS	@mark-otaris That package is fetched using git so look for an issue there.
2016-03-26 14:59:26	mark-otaris	Which host is it fetched from?
2016-03-26 14:59:42	NJBS	github
2016-03-26 14:59:51	mark-otaris	oh
2016-03-26 14:59:54	mark-otaris	github.com has DNSSEC too
2016-03-26 15:00:05	mark-otaris	.. I'm just going to use arm to get another Tor path and not have those problems anymore
2016-03-26 15:00:14	NJBS	:smile: 
2016-03-26 15:05:25	bsteindorf	when i want to write a mode (for syntaxhighlighting) do i write a layer in spacemacs or a mode?
2016-03-26 15:05:59	mark-otaris	bsteindorf: a mode, but you can write a layer as well
2016-03-26 15:06:46	mark-otaris	layers depend on modes and add bindings for them, documentation and so on
2016-03-26 15:06:56	mark-otaris	but they are not the modes themselves, the syntax highlighting is done by the mode and not by the layer
2016-03-26 15:08:10	bsteindorf	thanks i was a little bit unsure about that
2016-03-26 15:09:10	NJBS	@bsteindorf This explains it quite well http://spacemacs.org/doc/LAYERS.html
2016-03-26 15:10:10	mark-otaris	hm, how would I make ERC convert "@nick" to "nick: "?
2016-03-26 15:17:08	mark-otaris	How can I match a buffer by a regular expression and replace text in it with a regular expression? (e.g. s/^@(\w+)(\s)/\1:\2/g)
2016-03-26 15:18:02	codedmart	Can I change tab space from 4 to 2 on the fly?
2016-03-26 15:36:51	gilch	I found evil-visual-mark-mode on melpa. It makes the marks of evil visible. It's normally only active in normal mode. I'd like to only make it active when I'm about to move to or set a mark (i.e., when I press ``` ` ```, `'`, or `m`). Is there a hook for that, or is there some other way to do it?
2016-03-26 15:43:32	mullr	At the bottom of http://orgmode.org/manual/Internal-links.html it talks about how to do autocompletion for internal links. Is there a way to do this with the spacemacs bindings? I can't seem to find what M-TAB is bound to for org-mode in vanilla emacs. 
2016-03-26 15:47:48	mullr	.. It may be "pcomplete", perhaps
2016-03-26 15:53:12	gilch	 @gilch `defadvice` looks promising.
2016-03-26 16:01:54	choppsv1	I need to figure out how to remap `C-[` from `evil-jump-to-tag` to `gtags-find-tag-definition`
2016-03-26 16:02:04	choppsv1	global set key doesn't work.
2016-03-26 16:02:22	choppsv1	oh right I think I need to redefine it for the evil states..
2016-03-26 16:14:01	choppsv1	hmm still not wokring
2016-03-26 16:19:37	choppsv1	Also doing `SPC h d m` doesn't seem to even list C-[ even though it's mapped
2016-03-26 16:19:49	choppsv1	I think the evil state maps confuse that help

2016-03-26 16:32:32	choppsv1	well I got it to work by stopping trying to undefine C-] in normal state and instead just did the obvious `    (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-]") 'ggtags-find-tag-dwim)`
2016-03-26 16:33:03	choppsv1	I wish though that I could undefine it instead so that the keymaps below simply took over

2016-03-26 18:12:23	stockninja	I followed all the instructions:
2016-03-26 18:12:23	stockninja	- Installed python packages rope and pymacs
2016-03-26 18:12:23	stockninja	- Added these lines to my spacemacs/user-config:

2016-03-26 19:18:11	ashnur	I really wish there would be any way to make spacemacs support standard.js 
2016-03-26 19:21:38	NJBS	@ashnur It should already be supported.
2016-03-26 19:22:00	NJBS	`SPC e v` in a javascript buffer
2016-03-26 19:23:03	ashnur	@NJBS SPC e v is undefined
2016-03-26 19:23:31	ashnur	but i don't just mean the linter, i mean the format, like if I could actually write the kind of code
2016-03-26 19:24:38	ashnur	sadly, spacemacs is hostile to say the least towards anything javascript, allowing only some limited stuff through js2-mode but other than that, it's probably best if I try to configure vanilla emacs 
2016-03-26 19:25:00	ashnur	but I would be the happiest if someone would prove me wrong
2016-03-26 19:29:02	travisbhartwell	Curious, why do you consider Spacemacs hostile towards JS?
2016-03-26 19:30:46	ashnur	I am guessing because emacs in general is
2016-03-26 19:30:51	travisbhartwell	(I barely ever edit JS files, so I have no idea)
2016-03-26 19:31:44	travisbhartwell	What's the ideal JS editing environment at the moment?
2016-03-26 19:32:00	ashnur	that's an interesting question, what do you mean ideal?
2016-03-26 19:32:36	ashnur	i have very specific needs that are not covered by the needs of the 80% majority of js devs who just copy paste code from stackoverflow
2016-03-26 19:33:00	ashnur	primarily I wish to write code like this: http://standardjs.com/
2016-03-26 19:33:17	travisbhartwell	Well, I mean, I've heard that Emacs doesn't often support the latest JS syntax, etc.
2016-03-26 19:33:22	travisbhartwell	Is there an editor that keeps up with that?
2016-03-26 19:33:37	ashnur	but js2-mode, the only js mode supported (more or less) by spacemacs can't deal with that kind of code 
2016-03-26 19:34:09	ashnur	sublime, atom do, vim never had any issues, not being an operating system :D
2016-03-26 19:34:25	travisbhartwell	@travisbhartwell nods
2016-03-26 19:34:40	ashnur	sorry, but it's not about the latest js synta
2016-03-26 19:34:42	ashnur	[edit] sorry, but it's not about the latest js syntax
2016-03-26 19:34:56	ashnur	it's about comma first and semicolon-less code
2016-03-26 19:35:16	ashnur	neither of those are new in any sense of the word
2016-03-26 19:37:19	travisbhartwell	I'm pretty uneducated when it comes to JS :)
2016-03-26 19:37:41	ashnur	i think it's just that not many actual js devs use spacemacs. there is probably no one to do it, so I kinda wish I could learn how to do it in like 1-2 hours :P
2016-03-26 19:38:08	ashnur	but every time i just try to read up on the matter i see a wall of text that would take me weeks just to read and understand it
2016-03-26 19:39:18	travisbhartwell	Understandable.
2016-03-26 19:49:12	ZachMassia	Hi guys. I've written a minor-mode for vanilla Emacs, and a user has requested I create a layer for it. 
2016-03-26 19:49:12	ZachMassia	I've been reading the doc on layers, and I think I've got a general idea of how to go about writing it. 
2016-03-26 19:49:12	ZachMassia	Now for contributing it, do I create my own repo with the layer first, or simply fork spacemacs and send a PR?
2016-03-26 19:49:12	ZachMassia	Thanks

2016-03-28 13:29:57	StreakyCobra	@gilch Forum is mainly for people having problems, and mailing list is for issue discussing idea and future of Spacemacs. But don't be concern to much about these 3 labels. It's because we use Github issues as:
2016-03-28 13:29:57	StreakyCobra	1. Issues tracker
2016-03-28 13:29:57	StreakyCobra	2. Forum
2016-03-28 13:29:57	StreakyCobra	3. Mailing list
2016-03-28 13:29:57	StreakyCobra	that we introduced this to classify a little bit.
2016-03-28 13:37:07	Peeja	@danielberkompas You said you re-cloned and everything worked again? I'm having the same problem and re-cloning didn't help. I don't suppose there's anything else you might have done that fixed it…?
2016-03-28 13:39:36	Peeja	Here's the output from `--debug-init`, in case anyone has any ideas: https://gist.github.com/Peeja/a248087228990511a04e
2016-03-28 13:41:36	hansihe	When I switch to a projectile project and do helm-projectile-find-file, emacs seems to freeze up. Anyone else seen this?
2016-03-28 13:41:39	TheBB	@Peeja Redownload the packages while running with `--insecure`
2016-03-28 13:42:07	TheBB	Note that you're running byte code which contains a TLS error message.
2016-03-28 13:42:12	NJBS	@hansihe Does this happen regardless of what project you try it on? Projects with a huge amount of files have crashed emacs in the past.
2016-03-28 13:42:14	Peeja	Oh, I see, I tried `--insecure` but not while redownloading the packages. :thumbsup: 
2016-03-28 13:42:28	Peeja	*That's* what that's about :)
2016-03-28 13:43:55	hansihe	@NJBS will try with a tiny project
2016-03-28 13:47:41	hansihe	@NJBS tried it on a project with under 300 files, still freezes
2016-03-28 13:48:05	hansihe	that's hardly a large project
2016-03-28 13:52:31	NJBS	@hansihe Yeah, I was talking in the mutli-millions. Something else is wrong here. What's the value of `projectile-indexing-method`?
2016-03-28 13:56:04	choppsv1	@NJBS you mentioned stic functions and gtags.. I'm working on overhauling the gtags layer right now but don't know what you mean by stick functions, can you explain?

2016-03-28 13:59:55	NJBS	I actually meant to say eldoc, rather than sticky func @amosbird :smile: 
2016-03-28 14:01:18	choppsv1	oh
2016-03-28 14:01:26	choppsv1	ok .. and gtags has eldoc support
2016-03-28 14:02:33	NJBS	Only for languages that don't already have eldoc support.
2016-03-28 14:02:43	NJBS	There should be a list in the documentation if I remember correctly.
2016-03-28 14:05:59	hansihe	@NJBS alright, so I'm fairly new to emacs/spacemacs. That command does not seem to show up in the command buffer
2016-03-28 14:06:12	hansihe	is it a variable or something?
2016-03-28 14:06:31	NJBS	@hansihe Yeah, it's a variable. You can check its value using `SPC  h d v`.
2016-03-28 14:08:47	hansihe	@NJBS It's alien
2016-03-28 14:09:10	hansihe	on linux btw
2016-03-28 14:09:58	NJBS	@hansihe It uses `find` has its backend does `find` work properly from the commandline?
2016-03-28 14:10:40	NJBS	You can also try setting that value to `native` to have it use elisp to search your files, but it's much slower when compared to `find`.
2016-03-28 14:12:17	choppsv1	@NJBS I'm currently overhauling the gtags documentation, it's woefully lacking.
2016-03-28 14:12:26	choppsv1	And adding support to 30 more languages.
2016-03-28 14:13:06	choppsv1	Right now eldoc is only enalbed for a couple languages.. It would be good to figure out of those 30 new ones which don't have eldoc support so that I can add that as well.
2016-03-28 14:13:14	hansihe	@NJBS I use find fairly often, never had any issues before.
2016-03-28 14:13:23	hansihe	I can try using native
2016-03-28 14:15:54	Peeja	So, I've been tracking down why my `M-x` is so slow, and I'm seeing some odd results in the profile: https://gist.github.com/Peeja/7e24c3f7cc761faea08b
2016-03-28 14:16:43	Peeja	Two things I don't understand: Why does `helm-M-x-read-extended-command` involve calling `kill-buffer`, and why does `kill-buffer` call something deeply recursive?

2016-03-28 14:18:15	choppsv1	gah the ubuntu global package is *ancient*
2016-03-28 14:18:47	choppsv1	I added compile from source docs to the README, but maybe theres some ... ppa or whatever that's called for ubuntu global that would bring it into this decade?

2016-03-28 14:57:54	andrewsanchez	OK, so (defun dotspacemacs/user-init () and (defun dotspacemacs/user-config () isn't for variables, but intended for code/functions?
2016-03-28 14:58:40	TheBB	You can set variables there too, for example variables used by packages (outside of Spacemacs code).
2016-03-28 14:58:42	calebmeyer	user-init is for any code/functions/variables that need to be set before everything is loaded. user-config is for code/functions/variables that can wait until after everything else is loaded
2016-03-28 14:58:49	andrewsanchez	Damn, I just realized I could have answered this question simply by searching for `line-numbers` in my .spacemacs

2016-03-28 15:02:58	andrewsanchez	Thank you! @calebmeyer  @TheBB  one more question (for now):  What is the difference between variables that are set in dotspacemacs/init and variables set in user-init and user-config (aside from when they are loaded)?  Is it that user-init and user-config is reserved for custom written code/functions?
2016-03-28 15:03:37	calebmeyer	I believe that's correct
2016-03-28 15:04:05	calebmeyer	dotspacemacs/init is reserved for spacemacs stuff, user-init/user-config are for user stuff
2016-03-28 15:04:18	calebmeyer	Is this a typo? https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/core/templates/.spacemacs.template#L123
2016-03-28 15:05:05	calebmeyer	Also, do we usually raise github issues for typos, or is there one where we just report new typos as they come up? Or do we just ask here?

2016-03-28 20:00:09	amosbird	Hi all. How can I get the active keymaps of the helm minibuffer?
2016-03-28 20:03:21	choppsv1	hmm just looked at ggtags docs and it actually hooks into company as well.. so for things like tcl it supplies completion (just verified this, pretty cool!)
2016-03-28 20:04:02	choppsv1	so I guess for modes which don't have completion, but if autocomplete and gtags layers are enabled we should turn company mode on.

2016-03-28 20:38:17	NJBS	@amosbird helm-map is the parent map for all of those maps I believe. They should all inherit your changes to helm-map.
2016-03-28 20:39:17	NJBS	The only changes I think you need are the ones to helm-map, it should trickle down to all of helm's other keymaps.
2016-03-28 20:40:11	amosbird	@NJBS the first thing I tried is doing this :). No, it doesn't work for me.
2016-03-28 20:45:17	NJBS	@amosbird `helm-buffer-map` `helm-projectile-find-file-map` and `helm-projectile-projects-map` all seem properly set using just `helm-map`, do you get the same results?
2016-03-28 20:47:36	amosbird	@NJBS `(define-key helm-projectile-find-file-map (kbd "C-h") 'delete-backward-char)` this is needed.
2016-03-28 20:49:17	NJBS	@amosbird Ah, missed that binding. `helm-projectile-find-files-map` sets its own binding for `C-h` so it doesn't inherit the one from `helm-map`

2016-03-28 21:02:12	choppsv1	so IIRC on develop there's a hard requirement for emacs 24.4+?
2016-03-28 21:02:24	choppsv1	er >= 24.4
2016-03-28 21:02:47	NJBS	@amosbird Nevermind, that's actually spacemacs binding that :smile: which is why it isn't inheriting.
2016-03-28 21:03:15	NJBS	@choppsv1 Both `develop` and `master` have a 24.4 requirement because of `helm-flx` I believe.
2016-03-28 21:03:42	NJBS	Dropping support for 24.3 is a milestone for .106
2016-03-28 21:05:01	choppsv1	ok.. b/c I think I can also yank this eldoc stuff, the ggtags.el docs mention that 24.4+ it's enabled by default..
2016-03-28 21:05:10	choppsv1	[edit] ok.. b/c I think I can also remove this eldoc stuff, the ggtags.el docs mention that 24.4+ it's enabled by default..

2016-03-29 19:37:51	choppsv1	@tastycode try `web-mode-markup-indent-offset`
2016-03-29 19:38:15	choppsv1	set that in your user-config
2016-03-29 19:38:56	choppsv1	There really needs to be some sort of documentation about `spacemacs--indent-variable-alist` and the values used therein
2016-03-29 19:40:03	tastycode	@choppsv1 That works splendidly.. thank you so much! I was about to pipe to some sort of command line tidying utility.. 
2016-03-29 19:40:45	choppsv1	np, if you `SPC h d v` that variable I mention above it shows a list of modes and the variables that spacemacs uses to set the indent
2016-03-29 19:41:07	tastycode	thats immensly helpful
2016-03-29 19:41:52	tastycode	holy moly.. its like the master list of how spacemacs figures out how to indent!
2016-03-29 19:43:43	choppsv1	yeah.
2016-03-29 19:43:47	choppsv1	I use `    (dolist (e spacemacs--indent-variable-alist)
2016-03-29 19:43:47	choppsv1	      (if (symbolp (cdr e))
2016-03-29 19:43:47	choppsv1	          (if (not (eq 'lisp-indent-offset (cdr e)))
2016-03-29 19:43:47	choppsv1	              (set-default (cdr e) 4))
2016-03-29 19:43:47	choppsv1	        (dolist (x (cdr e)) (setq-default x 4))))
2016-03-29 19:43:47	choppsv1	`
2016-03-29 19:44:07	choppsv1	to set them all to 4, then I go back and set the couple I want to be different individually
2016-03-29 19:50:17	choppsv1	oh, btw, if you use setq-default you can just do it once in user-config vs. having to do it in a mode hook.
2016-03-29 19:51:12	tastycode	ah yes.. thats what i originally had, but thought that the reason why web-mode-markup-indent wasn't working was because of something having to do with the order of things, and maybe adding a hook would help

2016-03-29 21:08:13	NJBS	@kccai You can try to play around with Emacs batch mode and passing it things to evaluate via the commandline. See https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BatchMode.

2016-03-30 20:39:35	jlieviant	Hi, I encountered an error trying to start spacemacs. It was working just fine until this morning, and I haven't fiddled with any of the config files. Can I post the debug message here?
2016-03-30 20:55:19	cg82616424	Hi， I want to install spacemacs on my linux server,which do not have x11 user interface. will it works well on this environment ?

2016-03-30 22:04:15	syl20bnr	 I guess it can be problematic for some people using different fonts, it would be better to use `spacemacs|diminish` which takes two values to be used depending on `dotspacemacs-mode-line-unicode-symbols`

2016-03-30 22:05:33	jlieviant	Similar to this issue: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/5084
2016-03-30 22:06:00	jlieviant	except that I tried to delete the elpa folder and re-download all the packages, but encountered error while trying to contact orgmode.org
2016-03-30 22:06:02	syl20bnr	mmmmmmhhh did you upgrade your packages ?
2016-03-30 22:06:13	jlieviant	Yesterday, yes.
2016-03-30 22:06:42	syl20bnr	I had once some troubles with MELPA and corrupted archive
2016-03-30 22:06:53	syl20bnr	deleting elpa/archives fixed it
2016-03-30 22:07:00	syl20bnr	but here it seems to be an issue with org

2016-03-31 11:34:48	gigawhitlocks	so I assume you want C-mode to be active?
2016-03-31 11:35:16	michalvalasek	currently i'm doing this:

2016-03-31 11:37:54	calebmeyer	michalvalasek I've not found a way to do that the first time you visit a project. However, every subsequent time, you can use `SPC p h` then type the name of the project, then fuzzy find a filename in that project
2016-03-31 11:38:06	calebmeyer	(and `SPC p f` to find more files)

2016-03-31 11:46:27	gigawhitlocks	`(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ino\\'" . c-mode))` in your .spacemacs file
2016-03-31 11:46:30	gigawhitlocks	in the user config section
2016-03-31 11:47:05	gigawhitlocks	looking on the web there are a few arduino modes for emacs floating around too, if you want something more specific to arduino, though of course those will come without evilified bindings
2016-03-31 11:47:22	gigawhitlocks	@aimrie ^
2016-03-31 11:47:53	gigawhitlocks	I’m sure the owners of this project wouldn’t mind a contributed layer for one of those arduino modes though :)
2016-03-31 11:54:47	aimrie	@gigawhitlocks thanks, i actually am not going to be doing any arduino coding. just trying to get a grip on spacemacs and see how everything pans out. your help is much appreicated!
2016-03-31 11:55:04	gigawhitlocks	:D glad I could help
2016-03-31 11:56:31	kfrz	I messed up and killed a hung emacs process, now running  `emacs`  returns `emacs.d/spacemacs.mk: line 12: MAKEFILE_LIST: command not found`
2016-03-31 11:56:59	kfrz	it was giving me a permissions error on `spacemacs.mk` to which I applied `chmod +x`
2016-03-31 11:57:42	kfrz	Which resulted in a list of errors such as the command not found, here's a gist. https://gist.github.com/kfrz/0f66f834028840439816b5e3968e6d27
2016-03-31 11:58:22	kfrz	I can't find anything in the various docs and errata that suggest why my permissions would get messed up, but I wanted to check before I just reinstalled completely
2016-03-31 12:09:40	bbrik	@kfrz i wouldn't bother, just reinstall :)
2016-03-31 12:10:08	gigawhitlocks	especially since spacemacs rebuilds itself when  you do.. rm -rf, re-clone, go get coffee, come back to new working editor
2016-03-31 12:10:24	kfrz	fair enough. Thanks :) 
2016-03-31 12:33:21	mckinley-olsen	I somehow got into the emacs state... anyone know the key command to get back to "normal" state off the top of their head?
2016-03-31 12:34:20	kfrz	C-c? 
2016-03-31 12:35:32	travisbhartwell	C-z will switch back and forth between the two states
2016-03-31 12:36:59	mckinley-olsen	so it does. got through that, thank you!

2016-03-31 15:32:02	n4580	@j4 I haven’t used it, but Geben is probably what you’re looking for. If you’re on a Mac and use Codebug, there’s an emacs extension that lets you set your Codebug breakpoints from Spacemacs.

2016-04-01 11:35:36	WilsonChiang	Yes
2016-04-01 11:35:41	WilsonChiang	its some weirdness with my eslint config ive narrowed it down to
2016-04-01 11:35:46	WilsonChiang	it works in the project root, but not in a subfolder
2016-04-01 11:35:52	WilsonChiang	(but only some of them?)
2016-04-01 11:39:21	WilsonChiang	oh god damnit, my work is using 1.10.3 in `node_modules` for eslint
2016-04-01 11:39:29	WilsonChiang	would that effect it?
2016-04-01 11:40:37	wamaral	um, maybe? that's quite old
2016-04-01 11:41:00	wamaral	I have a project open right now, eslint is running fine
2016-04-01 11:41:09	wamaral	v2.5.3 though
2016-04-01 11:41:45	WilsonChiang	yeah! i think its some werid dependency on some other module
2016-04-01 11:41:51	WilsonChiang	Although i would think my globally installed eslint
2016-04-01 11:41:53	WilsonChiang	would pick up the .eslintrc
2016-04-01 11:41:57	WilsonChiang	which it does in my other projects..
2016-04-01 11:42:44	wamaral	yup, mine does that
2016-04-01 11:45:42	WilsonChiang	yeah pretty frusturating
2016-04-01 11:46:43	WilsonChiang	Seems to think its the espree parser for some reason
2016-04-01 11:47:20	wamaral	if you `SPC e s` and chose eslint, does it work?

2016-04-01 12:03:55	bbrik	I don't have any specific eslint configuration in spacemacs, only had to install eslint globally and have an .eslintrc in project root
2016-04-01 12:04:30	bbrik	the thing that was driving me crazy were the js2-mode warnings, that took me long to figure out

2016-04-01 12:10:30	CestDiego	`SPC f j` or `SPC  j f`
2016-04-01 12:14:22	WilsonChiang	@bbrik looks like its just a eslint version failure... our .eslintrc requires <2.0
2016-04-01 12:14:29	WilsonChiang	Is there anyway to have a specific eslint version run based on project?
2016-04-01 12:14:35	WilsonChiang	Rather not have to uninstall/reinstall versions everyday :)
2016-04-01 12:16:29	wamaral	updating .eslintrc to use >2.0 isn't an option?
2016-04-01 12:17:56	wamaral	you can create a new checker (I made one for flowtype), but I'm not sure how to set it as default per-project
2016-04-01 12:18:19	michael-krebs	has anyone figured out a sane way to keep tern from putting `.tern-port` files everywhere
2016-04-01 12:19:05	WilsonChiang	@wamaral I'd have to get it updated in the project, theres prob some crazy dependency crap on eslint for some of our build tools
2016-04-01 12:19:21	WilsonChiang	and id have to convince poeple that its a thing lol
2016-04-01 12:23:29	wamaral	@WilsonChiang I know your pain, sadly :)
2016-04-01 12:24:21	wamaral	@michael-krebs I have this in my `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers`:

2016-04-01 12:48:54	erikcw	I'm trying to add a small emacs package to my configuration.  It's just one file, which defines a function (no modes).  It is not on MELPA.  Is creating a layer the correct way to load it?  Or is there a better way to handle this?  https://github.com/jjasghar/alfred-org-capture/blob/master/el/alfred-org-capture.el
2016-04-01 12:50:18	NJBS	@erikcw You don't need a layer, you can use a quelpa recipe inside of `dotspacemacs-additional-packages`
2016-04-01 12:51:26	erikcw	@NJBS I haven't used quelpa -- is it built into spacemacs -- or do I need to install that first?
2016-04-01 12:55:25	erikcw	@NJBS nevermind -- looks like I have some quelpa functions available in SPC-:.  So something like `dotspacemacs-additional-packages '((haskell-mode :location "~/.emacs.d/private/local/alfred-org-capture"))`?
2016-04-01 13:19:18	NJBS	@erikcw No, you want to use a quelpa fetcher for a github repo.
2016-04-01 13:21:07	NJBS	`(your-package :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo "github-author-name/repo-name"))`
2016-04-01 13:22:49	NJBS	If you don't want to pull it from github you can use a file fetcher too, see the quelpa documentation. https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa#installing-with-a-recipe
2016-04-01 13:26:26	WilsonChiang	Hey so im trying to play around with magit - im not sure how the checkout works, is there a way to check out from a remote to a new branch locally?
2016-04-01 13:28:13	NJBS	@WilsonChiang from the magit status buffer you can press `b c` and it should let you checkout a remote and create a new branch.
2016-04-01 13:30:24	wamaral	or `b s` to create a branch from the current (if you're looking at origin/master, for example)

My googling is coming up empty, anyone run into something like this before?
2016-04-03 13:25:31	sp3ctum	how did you add the packages?
2016-04-03 13:26:12	bbakersmith	dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(my-package another-package)
2016-04-03 13:27:36	bbakersmith	but even if i clone a new .emacs.d from spacemacs repo and comment out the additional packages, it will fail now
2016-04-03 13:28:03	sp3ctum	weird.. have no idea
2016-04-03 13:28:22	bbakersmith	heh, yeah, me neither :)
2016-04-03 13:28:36	bbakersmith	this has not happened to me on linux, so maybe a mac os thing...
2016-04-03 13:28:52	sp3ctum	could it be your connection? are you using a proxy, or disallowed calls to elpa/melpa/wherever?
2016-04-03 13:29:03	sp3ctum	I'm on linux
2016-04-03 13:30:30	bbakersmith	my connection hasn't changed since it worked, nothing fancy like proxy or vpn, and it's pretty snappy. can easily ping melpa.org w like 65ms latency
2016-04-03 13:30:44	sp3ctum	I see `dotemacs-elpa-https and -elpa-timeout`
2016-04-03 13:30:48	sp3ctum	but am just guessing :(
2016-04-03 13:31:20	sp3ctum	what happens when the calls are timed out?
2016-04-03 13:32:03	bbakersmith	oho... i think you're on to something
2016-04-03 13:32:25	sp3ctum	try `dotspacemacs-verbose-loading t` and see `*Messages*`
2016-04-03 13:32:35	sp3ctum	[edit] try `dotspacemacs-verbose-loading t` and see the `*Messages*`buffer
2016-04-03 13:32:40	sp3ctum	after the timeout has happened, if you can
2016-04-03 13:33:14	Sardtok	@TheInitializer Try again with the latest version of the icons. I turned off compression and added 8-bit versions.
2016-04-03 13:34:07	TheInitializer	@Sardtok same dropbox link?
2016-04-03 13:34:52	sp3ctum	I want to create a new layer. where should I put it?
2016-04-03 13:35:03	sp3ctum	I don't intend it to be merged upstream, at least not yet.
2016-04-03 13:35:21	TheBB	Then put it wherever you like. :-P
2016-04-03 13:35:36	sp3ctum	in `/private` ?
2016-04-03 13:35:43	TheBB	That's in the load path, yes.
2016-04-03 13:35:56	bbakersmith	@sp3ctum I think maybe I just got lucky the first time with the timeout. Looks like increasing the timeout to 15s (from the default 5s) does the trick. Thanks for the tip, I should've been able to find that myself :)
2016-04-03 13:36:02	TheBB	You can of course add other paths to it.
2016-04-03 13:36:20	sp3ctum	@bbakersmith cool!
2016-04-03 13:36:26	sp3ctum	okay, thanks
2016-04-03 13:37:40	sp3ctum	is there an interface to imenu?
2016-04-03 13:37:54	sp3ctum	i'd like to find the variables/functions in the current file
2016-04-03 13:38:53	sp3ctum	`helm-imenu` works though, but has no binding. could it be that some other command uses it internally?
2016-04-03 13:39:04	TheInitializer	@Sardtok works now :D
2016-04-03 13:39:05	TheInitializer	http://u.cubeupload.com//X3PiMt.png

2016-04-03 14:09:56	rjhilgefort	Can anyone help me out on a workflow for find/replace all in project?
2016-04-03 14:11:04	rjhilgefort	I know I can `SPC /` or `SPC *` to get a list of matches. I’ve tried marking some and then looking through the available actions, but I don’t see any function that obviously looks like a “replace with"
2016-04-03 14:11:33	TheInitializer	Something like / or % I forget
2016-04-03 14:11:41	rjhilgefort	from which screen?
2016-04-03 14:11:47	rjhilgefort	after marking?
2016-04-03 14:13:23	TheInitializer	:%s/<text to find>/<text to replace it with>/g
2016-04-03 14:13:54	TheInitializer	in vim mode
2016-04-03 14:14:14	rjhilgefort	anyway to preview what you’ll match?
2016-04-03 14:14:17	rjhilgefort	in a flow
2016-04-03 14:14:23	rjhilgefort	rather than singular command?
2016-04-03 14:14:43	rjhilgefort	and will `/g` respect the projectile project?
2016-04-03 14:15:11	xiroV	I was wondering, how can I define some words that will automatically get replaced by something else when I type them? Think like, automatically correct a typically mispelled word.. Oh, and I only want it to apply to LaTeX files.
2016-04-03 14:18:31	TheBB	@rjhilgefort If you use ag you can `C-c C-e` to open results in a separate buffer, where you can edit and `C-c C-c` to commit them.
2016-04-03 14:18:47	TheBB	There you can use whatever search and replace-like function you wish.
2016-04-03 14:19:17	sp3ctum	@xiroV emacs has `global-abbrev-table` that does this
2016-04-03 14:19:27	TheBB	http://spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html#orgheadline161
2016-04-03 14:19:36	sp3ctum	http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_abbrev_mode.html
2016-04-03 14:19:44	rjhilgefort	@TheBB hmmm, okay. Are you recommending that I enter each file seperately from that seperate buffer?
2016-04-03 14:19:52	sp3ctum	[edit] @xiroV http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_abbrev_mode.html
2016-04-03 14:19:59	TheBB	No
2016-04-03 14:20:36	rjhilgefort	Okay, let me give what I think you mean a shot

2016-04-03 14:48:37	xiroV	@sp3ctum Thanks! Exactly what I was looking for.. However, I can't really make it work.. Should I just copy-paste the thing into the "defun dotspacemacs/user-config" part, or?

2016-04-03 15:00:40	adriandeveloper	Has anyone ever received this error before? 
2016-04-03 15:01:11	adriandeveloper	I was looking around and found no solution yet. Could be that what I'm looking for is wrong. 
2016-04-03 15:02:01	adriandeveloper	I'm on emacs 25-0-92.1 with the latest version of Spacemacs.
2016-04-03 15:04:08	TheInitializer	So when I'm cycling through buffers for a window, each one has a bar at the bottom which lets me left- or right-click to continue cycling. Except for the helm thingy. When I get to the helm thingy, the bar at the bottom completely disappears and the only way to switch to another buffer is to close it and open a new one. What can I do to fix this?
2016-04-03 15:04:40	TheInitializer	btw sorry if I used incorrect terminology, I'm a n00b at all this stuff

2016-04-03 15:24:15	TheBB	Well, helm buffers aren't supposed to be reused like that.
2016-04-03 15:25:02	TheBB	I'd find a better way to cycle buffers, that ignores useless ones, like `]b`, `[b`, `SPC bn`, `SPC bp` or the buffer microstate `SPC b.`
2016-04-03 15:27:14	TheInitializer	]b and [b are undefined
2016-04-03 15:27:25	TheBB	Not on develop.
2016-04-03 15:27:33	TheBB	Anyway the others should work.

2016-04-03 15:27:52	TheInitializer	SPC bn/p works
2016-04-03 15:27:52	TheBB	If you want them on master you should use the unimpaired layer.
2016-04-03 15:28:17	TheBB	And in any case you should use the unimpaired layer, because it's awesome.

2016-04-03 18:41:09	Pizza-Boy	Hey, was there a change in the spacemacs config recently that affected indenting?
2016-04-03 18:41:35	Pizza-Boy	So previously I noticed that my comments would automatically get indented by a tab after i pressed enter (which wasn't a big deal)

2016-04-03 18:44:13	Pizza-Boy	actually indenting in general is just really messed up in my spacemacs install right now. Don't know why.
2016-04-03 18:44:31	recifx	I tried setting key-bindings such as `  (global-set-key (kbd "C-f") 'avy-goto-char)` in dotspacemacs/user-int and dotspacemacs/user-config but they seem to be getting overridden by evil-scroll keys. Is there a recommended way to set personal keybindings.
2016-04-03 18:46:38	NJBS	@JAremko Change `dotspacemacs-emacs-command-key` in your `.spacemacs` file.
2016-04-03 18:46:59	Pizza-Boy	Sorry, I'm gonna expand on this a bit more. Like when I select all my text in visual mode and press tab (which previously would smart-indent everything) all the lines get indented over but like, i dunno, 2-3 tabs? Something's weird with my install but I'm not sure if it's my config (I don't think I changed anything recently but I might have), the ESS layer that I'm currently using, spacemacs itself, etc.
2016-04-03 18:48:00	JAremko	@NJBS   Thanks! 
2016-04-03 18:49:26	Pizza-Boy	Sorry, ignore me, there was a syntax error in the file (missing a bracket) that was throwing off the indenting. Not a spacemacs issue.
2016-04-03 18:51:41	neverfox	Does anyone know what's up with `Invalid face reference: t [59 times]` that appears in `*Messages*` whenever you scroll with the trackpad in OS X? (The number increases with every scroll)
2016-04-03 19:24:47	sdlovecraft	did anyone have problems getting spacemacs to read your custom eslintrc?

2016-04-04 12:38:19	landaire	@landaire hmmm this is addressed here: http://spacemacs.org/doc/FAQ.html#orgheadline43. I figured it'd be fixed by now in emacs HEAD
2016-04-04 12:40:35	landaire	is emacs-mac really maintained anymore?
2016-04-04 12:44:57	TheBB	> I figured it'd be fixed by now in emacs HEAD
2016-04-04 12:44:57	TheBB	I see you're not familiar with Emacs development. :-D
2016-04-04 12:45:40	landaire	definitely not
2016-04-04 12:46:10	landaire	I guess I'll have to deal with it though. emacs-mac-port's scrolling is pretty slow and bothersome

2016-04-04 13:40:16	rupertc	Hi guys, why is my emacs keep breaking the line when I enter a "space"
2016-04-04 13:40:28	rupertc	This automatic indentation is driving me crazy imma break this computer
2016-04-04 13:40:55	TheBB	You have auto-fill-mode turned on maybe?
2016-04-04 13:40:58	rupertc	For example, I deep into some react markup, hit the space bar during some attributes.. and it drops the line
2016-04-04 13:41:02	rupertc	is that auto-fill-mode related?
2016-04-04 13:41:21	TheBB	Well you can check if you have it on. If so try turning it off.
2016-04-04 13:41:28	rupertc	Thanks I will do that now
2016-04-04 13:41:46	rupertc	omg thats it

2016-04-04 16:25:31	ywecur	Another unrelated question: I used this line to make emacs start full screen on OS X: `(modify-frame-parameters nil '((fullscreen . fullboth) (fullscreen-restore . nil)))`
2016-04-04 16:25:41	ywecur	Anybody got any idea why?
2016-04-04 16:26:02	StreakyCobra	:+1: :-)
2016-04-04 16:26:44	StreakyCobra	Look into the issues, fullscreen on OS X has already been discussed several times IIRC
2016-04-04 16:26:45	hunner	@ywecur Isn't there `dotspacemacs-fullscreen-at-startup` that works to do that?
2016-04-04 16:27:39	ywecur	I don't know? It's not in the .spacemacs file by default
2016-04-04 16:28:55	hunner	@ywecur Ah, you can compare your .spacemacs with the latest template with `SPC f e D` and get an ediff buffer to add new changes. I think the variable will show up there
2016-04-04 16:28:57	StreakyCobra	https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/5633 and also maybe https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/4955 for references
2016-04-04 16:30:44	ywecur	hunner: No differnce I'm affraid :(
2016-04-04 16:32:30	ywecur	Alright, so SPC-T F works as expected. How do I make it execure that at boot?
2016-04-04 16:33:46	hunner	@ywecur Check out `dotspacemacs-fullscreen-at-startup` and `dotspacemacs-fullscreen-use-non-native` using variable help (`SPC h d v`) that you can add to your .spacemacs file
2016-04-04 16:34:07	hunner	Even if it's not in the diff, you can still add it manually :)
2016-04-04 16:35:21	hunner	Hmm. Why do we say `SPC h d v` etc instead of like `<SPC>hdv` (ie, using <> and not having spaces between the keypresses)?
2016-04-04 16:35:42	hunner	I guess the former is more readable, though less exact
2016-04-04 16:43:29	hunner	I guess vim convention would be `<Space>hdv` but extraplating emacs-like keys of `C-x C-s` it would be space-separated key presses, though with no way to represent spaces `SPC` is just invented as extra

2016-04-04 18:49:51	jonjitsu	I don't get the workflow for the org layer. After I list the todos and select one and hit enter, it opens it in a new buffer. But how do I go to that buffer? The normal buffer switching shortcuts are disabled. It's like it's in read only mode. Seems like the only way to get to the file is through find-file which is inconvenient

2016-04-04 21:59:30	choppsv1	trying to figure out how to do this in magit now.. :)
2016-04-04 22:05:58	travisbhartwell	@choppsv1 `SPC g s p -f` and then the letter corresponding to your remote
2016-04-04 22:06:07	travisbhartwell	usually p or u
2016-04-04 22:06:36	choppsv1	so.. I did `SPC g s` then I did `r e` and rebased onto develop
2016-04-04 22:06:49	choppsv1	which got me 2 conflicts which I just cleaned up.
2016-04-04 22:10:36	choppsv1	well I committed them, but magit still is in some sort of rebase buffer.

2016-04-04 22:11:16	choppsv1	hmm dunno why gitter always strips my newlines
2016-04-04 22:11:24	choppsv1	```gone 2642eb0 Expand gtags use to many more languages

2016-04-04 22:12:08	choppsv1	anyway it seemed to have worked, but not sure why i'm still looking at a rebase buffer instead of the normal magit one
2016-04-04 22:14:49	choppsv1	git cli tells me I need to `git rebase --continue` i have no idea how to tell magit to do that though 
2016-04-04 22:16:03	travisbhartwell	Try `r r` from the magit-status buffer
2016-04-04 22:16:42	choppsv1	yeah.. it failed

2016-04-04 22:20:54	choppsv1	ok.. well it said there was nothing to patch so I skipped, and finished and pushed to my repo.. 
2016-04-04 22:21:00	choppsv1	let's see how messed up this is
2016-04-04 22:22:26	choppsv1	god I think it worked
2016-04-04 22:23:02	choppsv1	at least the conflict I saw now shows the correct diff against the newer code it was conflicting against.
2016-04-04 22:23:26	choppsv1	@syl20bnr I fixed the gtags branch to not have conflicts if you want to look again! :)

2016-04-05 12:08:14	bennyty	Additionally when the window is scrolled using CTRL-e or y then the point is moved with j and k the whole jumps to center the points which I find very disorienting.
2016-04-05 12:09:35	mkomitee	Ok, it wasn't a commit to spacemacs, but an updated dependency.
2016-04-05 12:12:55	mkomitee	It's due to a change to swiper.
2016-04-05 12:13:00	dinosaur-lin	hi, I am using spacemacs in a terminal (putty) on a remote server. I can't copy text from putty to another app running (such as notepad) in windows (my host OS). but if I run "emacs -q" without spacemacs, I can copy text. So it should be some configuration in spacemacs is causing the issue. How can I fix this?
2016-04-05 12:15:52	sp3ctum	I'm trying to run `(auto-capitalize-mode)` in `text-mode-hook` but it doesn't seem to get added to the hook variable. is there something special about using hooks in spacemacs?

2016-04-05 12:56:37	WilsonChiang	Having some issues with using the python later. I get this error : http://pastebin.com/fj54jhQB
2016-04-05 13:02:35	calebmeyer	Might try `brew install python` I know apple's system python is woefully out of date
2016-04-05 13:02:42	calebmeyer	I don't know if it will help, but it's possible
2016-04-05 13:03:04	WilsonChiang	I actually just had to manually set it to use my homebrew directory 
2016-04-05 13:03:11	WilsonChiang	was just pointing in wrong spot for some reason!
2016-04-05 13:11:39	WilsonChiang	is the python layer not capable of refactoring variable/func names and stuff?
2016-04-05 13:13:02	mashify	Since it got much more silent now. I'll repeat my question from 4 hours ago just in case someone hasn't seen it but would have an awesome answer for me:
2016-04-05 13:13:02	mashify	So i got this sweet bind: (define-key evil-insert-state-map [C-g] 'evil-normal-state) Now it seems like C-g does a lot of other things and therefore I sometimes have to press C-g like four times... How can I unbind C-g in insert-mode or how can I just get it to work when I press C-g for the first time?
2016-04-05 13:19:26	calebmeyer	If a more specific state than insert state is active, it will always hijack your C-g binding
2016-04-05 13:20:00	calebmeyer	C-g is cancel in straight emacs, so it will cancel anything it can first
2016-04-05 13:20:29	calebmeyer	I'm not sure how it's bound in emacs itself, if you could find that binding, you might be able to advice it

2016-04-05 13:38:02	calebmeyer	Is there a way to switch to a project without opening any files from that project?

2016-04-05 13:39:15	calebmeyer	for example, let's say I'm working on one project and have a bunch of stuff open, can I do magit stuff with a different project without opening a random file?
2016-04-05 13:41:01	jmay	@calebmeyer This bothers me too. `SPC p p` insists on picking a file. Often I just want to jump to the project top directory
2016-04-05 13:42:33	calebmeyer	I mean, ideally I'd love for projects to have their own perspectives, but there's already an issue out for that. Then switching to a project just means loading up everything that you were working on last time you looked at the project
2016-04-05 13:43:02	travisbhartwell	That would be awesome
2016-04-05 13:44:36	calebmeyer	It also means you could make an IRC project that's tied to wherever you put your erc configs, and use it to switch to your IRC. Ditto for gnus and mail
2016-04-05 13:53:05	TheBB	@calebmeyer @jmay `SPC p p` has an action for magit status
2016-04-05 13:53:15	TheBB	As `C-z` will tell you.
2016-04-05 13:53:54	TheBB	It also has an action for opening dired in the root directory.
2016-04-05 13:53:59	TheBB	Again, as `C-z` will tell you. ;-)
2016-04-05 13:54:28	calebmeyer	I don't see the magit status option under C-z
2016-04-05 13:55:13	calebmeyer	Oh, you have to C-z before you pick the project
2016-04-05 13:55:53	TheBB	It'll tell you the keybinding as well so you don't have to `C-z` next time

2016-04-05 16:35:36	a13ph	@yhshin11 If you write in lisp instead of regex, that should be easier, since then you'll have more extensibility. Lisp is also definitely better for any sophisticated regex usage.
2016-04-05 16:35:36	a13ph	There are converters (somewhat limited) between those and similar tools , like other regex dialects
