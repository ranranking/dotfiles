2016-03-26 14:29:54	mark-otaris	Oh, however it's not with Emacs 25.0, so I should mention that in the issue

2016-03-26 14:39:26	mark-otaris	it seems the same is happening in this Debian container with Emacs 24.4
2016-03-26 14:41:21	travisbhartwell	Yeah, that happens every so often
2016-03-26 14:42:00	mark-otaris	https://clbin.com/Fk4ibc.png
2016-03-26 14:42:50	mark-otaris	I can't tell what it's related to, but in any case it happens both on my Fedora install with Emacs 24.5 and in a clean Debian container with Emacs 24.4, so I see no way it could be related to my configuration
2016-03-26 14:44:22	mark-otaris	oh
2016-03-26 14:44:26	mark-otaris	melpa.org gets a SERVFAIL with dig
2016-03-26 14:44:44	mark-otaris	awesome, I know how to fix this
2016-03-26 14:45:47	mark-otaris	org-mode.org, elpa.gnu.org and melpa.org all have DNSSEC?
2016-03-26 14:45:48	bsteindorf	i want to write a mode for a custom scripting language i found out how, but what is the correct way in spacemacs? is it `<SPC> : configuration-layer/create-layer RET` ?
2016-03-26 14:46:01	mark-otaris	this is what happens when a Tor exit node's ISP messes with DNS
2016-03-26 14:47:08	mark-otaris	@mark-otaris restarts Emacs
2016-03-26 14:47:17	mark-otaris	everything works as expecte—or not...
2016-03-26 14:47:27	mark-otaris	—or yes
2016-03-26 14:49:32	mark-otaris	NJBS: I found the solution to the problem
2016-03-26 14:52:28	NJBS	@mark-otaris :thumbsup: Could you maybe add your experience to that issue in case someone sees it in the same situation?
2016-03-26 14:52:53	mark-otaris	NJBS: well, in the same situation...
2016-03-26 14:53:59	mark-otaris	I have my system set up to make all outgoing connections go through the Tor network. One of the exit nodes has an ISP that messes with DNS records. I also have dnssec-triggerd set up with a local Unbound DNS resolver which validates DNSSEC-signed records. By messing with the DNS records, that ISP makes the signatures invalid and thus Unbound gives a SERVFAIL when trying to resolve those 
2016-03-26 14:54:00	mark-otaris	domains.
2016-03-26 14:54:13	mark-otaris	It turns out melpa.org, elpa.gnu.org and org-mode.org have DNSSEC (how they all come to have it I don't know)
2016-03-26 14:54:29	mark-otaris	so they got a SERVFAIL and weren't able to resolve, and thus of course Emacs wasn't able to connect to them and download packages
2016-03-26 14:55:34	mark-otaris	the solution in my case was to run tor-resolve melpa.org, tor-resolve elpa.gnu.org, tor-resolve elpa.org-mode.org and to add the IP addresses with the domain names to /etc/hosts
2016-03-26 14:56:09	mark-otaris	and since the container was running on the Fedora system, it used the local DNS resolver as well and had the same problem
2016-03-26 14:57:13	travisbhartwell	Sounds overly complicated :)
2016-03-26 14:57:29	mark-otaris	It is, I doubt anyone else is ever going to get this issue.
2016-03-26 14:58:36	mark-otaris	that said I have another issue now... https://clbin.com/WG2Nyb.png
2016-03-26 14:59:13	NJBS	@mark-otaris That package is fetched using git so look for an issue there.
2016-03-26 14:59:26	mark-otaris	Which host is it fetched from?
2016-03-26 14:59:42	NJBS	github
2016-03-26 14:59:51	mark-otaris	oh
2016-03-26 14:59:54	mark-otaris	github.com has DNSSEC too
2016-03-26 15:00:05	mark-otaris	.. I'm just going to use arm to get another Tor path and not have those problems anymore
2016-03-26 15:00:14	NJBS	:smile: 
2016-03-26 15:05:25	bsteindorf	when i want to write a mode (for syntaxhighlighting) do i write a layer in spacemacs or a mode?
2016-03-26 15:05:59	mark-otaris	bsteindorf: a mode, but you can write a layer as well
2016-03-26 15:06:46	mark-otaris	layers depend on modes and add bindings for them, documentation and so on
2016-03-26 15:06:56	mark-otaris	but they are not the modes themselves, the syntax highlighting is done by the mode and not by the layer
2016-03-26 15:08:10	bsteindorf	thanks i was a little bit unsure about that
2016-03-26 15:09:10	NJBS	@bsteindorf This explains it quite well http://spacemacs.org/doc/LAYERS.html
2016-03-26 15:10:10	mark-otaris	hm, how would I make ERC convert "@nick" to "nick: "?
2016-03-26 15:17:08	mark-otaris	How can I match a buffer by a regular expression and replace text in it with a regular expression? (e.g. s/^@(\w+)(\s)/\1:\2/g)
2016-03-26 15:18:02	codedmart	Can I change tab space from 4 to 2 on the fly?
2016-03-26 15:36:51	gilch	I found evil-visual-mark-mode on melpa. It makes the marks of evil visible. It's normally only active in normal mode. I'd like to only make it active when I'm about to move to or set a mark (i.e., when I press ``` ` ```, `'`, or `m`). Is there a hook for that, or is there some other way to do it?
2016-03-26 15:43:32	mullr	At the bottom of http://orgmode.org/manual/Internal-links.html it talks about how to do autocompletion for internal links. Is there a way to do this with the spacemacs bindings? I can't seem to find what M-TAB is bound to for org-mode in vanilla emacs. 
2016-03-26 15:47:48	mullr	.. It may be "pcomplete", perhaps
2016-03-26 15:53:12	gilch	 @gilch `defadvice` looks promising.
2016-03-26 16:01:54	choppsv1	I need to figure out how to remap `C-[` from `evil-jump-to-tag` to `gtags-find-tag-definition`
2016-03-26 16:02:04	choppsv1	global set key doesn't work.
2016-03-26 16:02:22	choppsv1	oh right I think I need to redefine it for the evil states..
2016-03-26 16:14:01	choppsv1	hmm still not wokring
2016-03-26 16:19:37	choppsv1	Also doing `SPC h d m` doesn't seem to even list C-[ even though it's mapped
2016-03-26 16:19:49	choppsv1	I think the evil state maps confuse that help

2016-03-26 16:32:32	choppsv1	well I got it to work by stopping trying to undefine C-] in normal state and instead just did the obvious `    (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-]") 'ggtags-find-tag-dwim)`
2016-03-26 16:33:03	choppsv1	I wish though that I could undefine it instead so that the keymaps below simply took over

2016-03-26 18:12:23	stockninja	I followed all the instructions:
2016-03-26 18:12:23	stockninja	- Installed python packages rope and pymacs
2016-03-26 18:12:23	stockninja	- Added these lines to my spacemacs/user-config:

2016-03-26 19:18:11	ashnur	I really wish there would be any way to make spacemacs support standard.js 
2016-03-26 19:21:38	NJBS	@ashnur It should already be supported.
2016-03-26 19:22:00	NJBS	`SPC e v` in a javascript buffer
2016-03-26 19:23:03	ashnur	@NJBS SPC e v is undefined
2016-03-26 19:23:31	ashnur	but i don't just mean the linter, i mean the format, like if I could actually write the kind of code
2016-03-26 19:24:38	ashnur	sadly, spacemacs is hostile to say the least towards anything javascript, allowing only some limited stuff through js2-mode but other than that, it's probably best if I try to configure vanilla emacs 
2016-03-26 19:25:00	ashnur	but I would be the happiest if someone would prove me wrong
2016-03-26 19:29:02	travisbhartwell	Curious, why do you consider Spacemacs hostile towards JS?
2016-03-26 19:30:46	ashnur	I am guessing because emacs in general is
2016-03-26 19:30:51	travisbhartwell	(I barely ever edit JS files, so I have no idea)
2016-03-26 19:31:44	travisbhartwell	What's the ideal JS editing environment at the moment?
2016-03-26 19:32:00	ashnur	that's an interesting question, what do you mean ideal?
2016-03-26 19:32:36	ashnur	i have very specific needs that are not covered by the needs of the 80% majority of js devs who just copy paste code from stackoverflow
2016-03-26 19:33:00	ashnur	primarily I wish to write code like this: http://standardjs.com/
2016-03-26 19:33:17	travisbhartwell	Well, I mean, I've heard that Emacs doesn't often support the latest JS syntax, etc.
2016-03-26 19:33:22	travisbhartwell	Is there an editor that keeps up with that?
2016-03-26 19:33:37	ashnur	but js2-mode, the only js mode supported (more or less) by spacemacs can't deal with that kind of code 
2016-03-26 19:34:09	ashnur	sublime, atom do, vim never had any issues, not being an operating system :D
2016-03-26 19:34:25	travisbhartwell	@travisbhartwell nods
2016-03-26 19:34:40	ashnur	sorry, but it's not about the latest js synta
2016-03-26 19:34:42	ashnur	[edit] sorry, but it's not about the latest js syntax
2016-03-26 19:34:56	ashnur	it's about comma first and semicolon-less code
2016-03-26 19:35:16	ashnur	neither of those are new in any sense of the word
2016-03-26 19:37:19	travisbhartwell	I'm pretty uneducated when it comes to JS :)
2016-03-26 19:37:41	ashnur	i think it's just that not many actual js devs use spacemacs. there is probably no one to do it, so I kinda wish I could learn how to do it in like 1-2 hours :P
2016-03-26 19:38:08	ashnur	but every time i just try to read up on the matter i see a wall of text that would take me weeks just to read and understand it
2016-03-26 19:39:18	travisbhartwell	Understandable.
2016-03-26 19:49:12	ZachMassia	Hi guys. I've written a minor-mode for vanilla Emacs, and a user has requested I create a layer for it. 
2016-03-26 19:49:12	ZachMassia	I've been reading the doc on layers, and I think I've got a general idea of how to go about writing it. 
2016-03-26 19:49:12	ZachMassia	Now for contributing it, do I create my own repo with the layer first, or simply fork spacemacs and send a PR?
2016-03-26 19:49:12	ZachMassia	Thanks
