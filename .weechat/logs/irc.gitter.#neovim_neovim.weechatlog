2016-03-26 18:11:29	HarmtH	Oops my bad, I accidentally tried jobsend(..,"^V^C") because I first tried embedding it into a mapping and then saw ^C appearing in the terminal without transmitting a signal.

2016-03-26 19:32:57	akatrevorjay	Hey guys, I'm noticing major slowdowns in my NeoVim on *exit*
2016-03-26 19:33:01	akatrevorjay	How do I profile that?
2016-03-26 19:34:22	akatrevorjay	Also, is there a way to specify an exclusion list of remote plugins to not load? I have plugins that have submodules of the same rplugin and it's causing quite a few of them to be registered, all at different versions.

2016-03-26 19:39:41	Shougo	You should use lazy loading in plugin managers

2016-03-26 19:39:57	Shougo	> How do I profile that?
2016-03-26 19:40:07	Shougo	I think neovim waits the remote commands.
2016-03-26 19:40:17	Shougo	It should be improved though.
2016-03-26 19:41:46	Shougo	You should create the new issue for exit performance
2016-03-26 20:43:14	marvim	`wsdjeg` what is the omni plugin for rust?

2016-03-26 21:02:40	marvim	`wsdjeg` RUST_SRC_PATH environment variable must be set to point to the src directory of a rust checkout. E.g. "/home/foouser/src/rust/src"
2016-03-26 21:02:57	Shougo	Yes
2016-03-26 21:03:08	marvim	`wsdjeg` does it mean I need set an evn RUST_SRC_PATH to rust src?
2016-03-26 21:03:20	marvim	`wsdjeg` or the src of my project
2016-03-26 21:03:40	Shougo	You must  download rust source code.
2016-03-26 21:03:54	Shougo	And specify the path to $RUST_SRC_PATH
2016-03-26 21:04:27	Shougo	Example: `let $SRC_RUST_PATH = "~/src/rust"`
2016-03-26 21:04:44	marvim	`wsdjeg` but I install rust by pacman ,it is diff version from source.git

2016-03-28 14:26:21	marvim	`zandrmartin` depends on your platform and needs. i just use gnome terminal because my needs are simple and it is there
2016-03-28 14:26:38	marvim	`zandrmartin` it doesn't offer much in the way of configurability though

2016-03-28 15:40:46	marvim	`haasn` There's something I've always found annoyingly lacking in vim: The fact that you have to use vim's built-in window/buffer management if you want to get multiple views into the same file. I find it rather confusing, limiting and annoying to be using vim's window management when I have a much better system-wide window manager
2016-03-28 15:40:58	marvim	`haasn` What I would _love_ is the ability to have multiple “front-ends” into the same vim instance

2016-03-28 16:15:46	marvim	`teto` haasn: there is an issue about that, it's not yet possible but through some hacks you can make the situation better. I can use the same mappings to move between nvim splits and my WM windows
2016-03-28 16:17:59	marvim	`haasn` Hmm that might be nicer than the status quo at least
2016-03-28 16:19:10	marvim	`teto` I got a strange bug, toggling only enables but does not disable for various plugins such as Valloric/ListToggle or vimtex. I used a minimal_init.vim and it works as expected. I dunno how to debug other then commenting

2016-03-30 10:13:48	marvim	`replicant` then if your terminal supports it, or you use a patched version of tmux 2.1, its hould work

2016-03-30 13:48:57	HiPhish	replicant: Here is my init.vim, hope you find what you are looking for. http://pastebin.com/vg3q08sP
2016-03-30 13:49:15	HiPhish	As I said, I don't use tmux, so I don't have any settings for that.
2016-03-30 13:50:57	marvim	`replicant` thanks tons HiPhish; yeah my problem is specific to neovim in tmux; as mentioend, outside of tmux it works like a champ
2016-03-30 13:51:02	marvim	`replicant` i'll poke around and see if i see anything
2016-03-30 13:51:06	marvim	`replicant` thanks for taking the time to compile that for me
2016-03-30 13:53:52	HiPhish	No problem, I haven't compiled anything, it's just my raw init.vim minus some personal stuff :) You'll have to cut through a lot of unrelated stuff.
2016-03-30 14:17:31	hkupty	I just took tmux out of my stack recently due to some neovim in tmux problems
2016-03-30 14:18:18	hkupty	I also wrote a plugin to port tmux bindings to neovim, so you can use neovim as a terminal multiplexer
2016-03-30 14:18:49	hkupty	if you'd like to try, its here https://github.com/hkupty/nvimux
2016-03-30 14:22:53	marvim	`replicant` oh wow, thanks hkupty

2016-03-30 15:46:55	marvim	`Xerkus` hm
2016-03-30 15:47:15	marvim	`Xerkus` can i make rpcstart use sockets?
2016-03-30 16:01:38	marvim	`samadivk` i've been using vim for a while, but i'm just now considering using neovim. can someone compare the advantages and disadvantages of each?
2016-03-30 16:16:01	gitter	[Github] tarruda commented in neovim/neovim on issue: Get Neovim to run on the Windows Subsystem for Linux https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/4507#issuecomment-203663529
2016-03-30 16:16:48	marvim	`herrbischoff` samadivk: as of now, there are no immediate advantages or disadvantages of both. Neovim supports asynchronous tasks though but the plugins need to be updated for it. Other than that, for general text editing you will probably notice no difference. Remember, Neovim is a fork of Vim that strives to update and clean up the code base while preserving compatibility as far as possible.
2016-03-30 16:17:37	marvim	`samadivk` herrbischoff: okay, thanks
2016-03-30 16:17:59	marvim	`samadivk` i'll probably try out both and see which i prefer
2016-03-30 16:18:02	marvim	`herrbischoff` samadivk: Another thing, you can use a Terminal inside Neovim, with :term
2016-03-30 16:18:11	marvim	`samadivk` that's handy
2016-03-30 16:18:29	marvim	`samadivk` although i could just use tmux
2016-03-30 16:18:47	marvim	`samadivk` but integration into vim _would_ be cool
2016-03-30 16:18:49	equalsraf	also check for plugins with specific support for Neovim like Neomake
2016-03-30 16:19:22	marvim	`herrbischoff` Yes, Neomake is cool, Deoplete is another async plugin
2016-03-30 16:19:25	equalsraf	thats the easiest way to see the difference between Neovim/Vim
2016-03-30 16:20:12	marvim	`Xerkus` @Shougo are you around?
2016-03-30 16:20:27	marvim	`Xerkus` @Shougo i think this condition is wrong https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/autoload/remote/host.vim#L39
2016-03-30 16:20:40	ibash	WAHAGAGAGAHAGAGH
2016-03-30 16:20:47	marvim	`shou15` Why?
2016-03-30 16:20:47	ibash	whenever marvim talkgs I get a notification
2016-03-30 16:21:16	marvim	`Xerkus` i think it should check for s:plugins_for_host
2016-03-30 16:21:32	marvim	`Xerkus` since registering any plugin host makes s:hosts non-empty
2016-03-30 16:22:07	marvim	`Xerkus` and  load remote plugins does not modify s:hosts from what i can see
2016-03-30 16:24:21	marvim	`shou15` It should be executed onetime.
2016-03-30 16:24:25	gitter	[Github] equalsraf commented in neovim/neovim on issue: Get Neovim to run on the Windows Subsystem for Linux https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/4507#issuecomment-203665348
2016-03-30 16:25:09	marvim	`shou15` Because the registration is cached.
2016-03-30 16:25:56	marvim	`Xerkus` yes, but from what i can see, it is always false condition
2016-03-30 16:26:20	marvim	`Xerkus` unless no plugin hosts are registered, then require makes no sense?
2016-03-30 16:26:37	marvim	`shou15` Hm.
2016-03-30 16:26:51	marvim	`shou15` It is already loaded.
2016-03-30 16:27:22	marvim	`shou15` What is the proalem?
2016-03-30 16:27:37	marvim	`shou15` I cannot understand.
2016-03-30 16:27:49	marvim	`psyq` quick question is there a GUI version of neovim?
2016-03-30 16:28:11	marvim	`shou15` You should create new issue.
2016-03-30 16:28:33	marvim	`shou15` I will responce to it.
2016-03-30 16:29:13	marvim	`Xerkus` i'm reading code, and i am not sure i understand it right to say if it is not what it intended to be, and since you are to git blame, i pinged you
2016-03-30 16:29:21	marvim	`shou15` You should explain the more detailed information
2016-03-30 16:29:48	marvim	`shou15` It is intended.
2016-03-30 16:30:42	marvim	`shou15` But if any problem exists, I will fix.

2016-03-30 17:01:35	marvim	`herrbischoff` The only thing I miss is the ability to double-click files in Finder and open them in Neovim instead of another GUI editor.

2016-03-31 12:25:28	jamessan	@jamessan still doesn't understand why unrelated tests seem to be failing just for #4492
2016-03-31 12:26:14	justinmk	the new non-luajit lua tests are flakey (possibly because they are slower). I asked @tarruda to address it
2016-03-31 12:26:43	justinmk	I made the builds green in january, and it's disappointing to see a bunch of false failures again now.
2016-03-31 12:27:37	justinmk	red builds are noise and having to restart builds all the time is very annoying.
2016-03-31 12:29:19	justinmk	Regarding @hkupty 's question though, it's not a good idea to only look at the main repo as a metric of activity.
2016-03-31 12:29:36	justinmk	neovim-qt and libmpack have been seeing significant work

2016-03-31 12:34:08	jamessan	on gitter, yes
2016-03-31 12:34:21	jamessan	I'm also connected on IRC, but I can't use that from work ;)
2016-03-31 12:34:33	marvim	`goddard` marvim: ahh gitter...i hate gitter haha :D
2016-03-31 12:34:51	tarruda	@jamessan yes, that error can be ignored
2016-03-31 12:35:22	marvim	`goddard` its tearing our dear development community apart ... where everyone once just went to freenode now we use browsers to talk
2016-03-31 12:35:45	tarruda	I will merge it later today
2016-03-31 12:35:50	marvim	`goddard` cool you setup a relay though
2016-03-31 12:35:55	justinmk	can we add lua-functionaltest to "ignore" in .travis.yml ?
2016-03-31 12:36:08	jamessan	tarruda: Thanks :)
2016-03-31 12:36:50	tarruda	justinmk I'd like to keep it non-ignored for now, at least it will make people check that the test is compatible with lua 5.1(syntatically speaking)
2016-03-31 12:37:22	tarruda	if the build errors because of cursor_spec.lua, it is safe to ignore
2016-03-31 12:37:24	jamessan	goddard: Considering it's enabled me to be involved when I'm not able to use IRC, I see that as quite the opposite to tearing the community apart
2016-03-31 12:37:36	tarruda	I wish there was a way to ignore only certain errors
2016-03-31 12:38:59	jamessan	Can tests be marked flaky?  I'm not very familiar with busted, but I know of some test harnesses that allow that
2016-03-31 12:39:45	tarruda	hmm, I think we can ignore that specific test if FUNCTIONALTEST env var is set to functionaltest-lua
2016-03-31 12:39:53	justinmk	yes
2016-03-31 12:40:11	justinmk	pending("foo", function()end)

2016-03-31 13:34:43	tjdevries	Once I've marked a pull request as RFC and the tag has changed, is there anything else I need to do to start getting feedback? I know it's been recently said that many of the more prominent devs are quite busy right now, so it's fine if it takes awhile to get around to the PR I submitted, just wanted to check that I'm doing it correctly. This is my first PR for neovim.
2016-03-31 13:36:20	marvim	`goddard` replicant: thats how you do it!
2016-03-31 13:45:54	justinmk	@tjdevries definitely leave a comment, otherwise github doesn't notify anyone
2016-03-31 13:47:07	tjdevries	Okay, I can do that. My PR has to do with adding centered text in the statusline, is there any one in particular I should mention in the comment for them to look at it?

2016-03-31 14:06:06	marvim	`replicant` those of you using latest neovim (head), latest tmux 2.1, and iterm2 nightly, do you have cursorshape switching working? it works for me outside of tmux, but when using neovim within tmux, it fails, using `let $NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_CURSOR_SHAPE=1`
2016-03-31 14:06:40	marvim	`replicant` just wondering if there was something special you had to do with neovim for that to work with tmux, OR alternatively, if you had to do something special with tmux

2016-03-31 14:40:22	jamessan	@tjdevries I'd also suggest posting the patch to vim_dev to see if Bram is interested, although the coding styles and testing are different.  For things like this which aren't specific to Neovim's particular divergences from Vim, I'm a fan of trying to get the change into both editors.
2016-03-31 14:41:46	tjdevries	I'm not really familiar with that process exactly. Could you point me to somewhere where I could read about it or if it's simple give me a few pointers?

2016-03-31 14:48:15	jamessan	You could either do it as a PR to vim/vim or send mail.  Sourceforge is having issues right now, so I can't link you to the part of Vim's website that describes the mailing lists
2016-03-31 14:51:05	tjdevries	Okay thanks. Would you recommend doing that now, or waiting until the PR is nearly finished for Neovim? I looked at the same section of code in Vim's source right now and it does seem quite similar, so I don't think the port would be terribly difficult after I finish the PR for Neovim. I also agree that I would like to try and keep Neovim and Vim functionality very close, so adding this feature to Vim would be a lot of fun as well.

2016-03-31 16:30:23	brcolow	@tarruda now that lua-client uses libmpack, what is the next step?
2016-03-31 16:30:54	tarruda	brcolow not yet, I'm still fixing some edges
2016-03-31 16:31:28	brcolow	but what is the next step? libmpack got a lua binding, lua-client uses libmpack...then what?
2016-03-31 16:32:44	tarruda	but the next step is the UI client library, which is basically is the ugrid.c from neovim core with some extra goodies
2016-03-31 16:33:30	tarruda	I will use these two to implement the first UI which will follow this concept I detailed in neovim-qt: https://github.com/equalsraf/neovim-qt/issues/50
2016-03-31 16:33:49	tarruda	This will fix a lot of issues the UI implementations have now
2016-03-31 16:34:10	brcolow	what language will the UI client library be in? lua? and what will it be called? libnvim-ui-client? :D
2016-03-31 16:34:20	tarruda	it will be C
2016-03-31 16:34:28	tarruda	didn't think much of a name yet
2016-03-31 16:34:34	brcolow	sounds really cool :D
2016-03-31 16:34:36	tarruda	libnvim-client
2016-03-31 16:34:53	tarruda	sounds reasonable
2016-03-31 16:34:54	brcolow	then any language with a FFI to C can use it for building a UI in that language?
2016-03-31 16:35:12	tarruda	yes
2016-03-31 16:36:04	tarruda	right now I'm using the lua client to test libmpack, make it nice for  binding to any language
2016-03-31 16:36:27	brcolow	sounds really cool tbhg
2016-03-31 16:36:46	tarruda	but the goal is to have a higher level libnvim-client that wraps the boring stuff in a simple interface
2016-03-31 16:40:10	marvim	`samadivk` anyone used nyaovim?
2016-03-31 16:41:27	brcolow	yes, makes total sense

2016-04-04 12:07:09	jamox	Thanks, I don't like the fix, but this one worked: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2048#issuecomment-98307896 (clearing cache and reinstalling head with homebrew didn't help...)
2016-04-04 12:07:24	jamox	but now I can proceed with the things I needed to do
2016-04-04 13:50:20	marvim	`jaawerth` Hi all! On day 2 of ftplugin and loving the switch - question, though: should ~/.config/nvim/after/ftplugin/filetype.vim as opposed to ~/.config/nvim/ftplugin... not work? Because it doesn't seem to the way it works in vim
2016-04-04 13:51:26	marvim	— `lhx` says thank you to any nvim devs in here... I'm on day 3 or so of switching and I'm loving it so far!

2016-04-04 18:56:46	marvim	`josephholsten` hmm, `:vnoremap <M-LeftMouse> :!xargs open<Enter>` is almost what I want, but it sends off the whole line
2016-04-04 19:04:46	marvim	`josephholsten` if only :`<,`> were a real thing
2016-04-04 19:06:45	marvim	`josephholsten` seriously, how does one pipe just the selected text through an external command.
2016-04-04 19:07:07	marvim	`josephholsten` more importantly, how have I never figured this out in the last two decades
2016-04-04 19:08:34	marvim	`joaumg` josephholsten: maybe y :!echo C-r", not sure
2016-04-04 19:13:23	marvim	`josephholsten` I'm clearly not entering that correctly
2016-04-04 19:13:41	marvim	`josephholsten` my test command right now is `:vnoremap <M-LeftMouse> :!tr [a-z] [A-Z]<Enter>`
2016-04-04 19:14:33	marvim	`josephholsten` what's this `C-r",` you're mentioning?

2016-04-05 15:23:53	bfredl	@brcolow I heard about this  https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=44266 it is  for python 2.7 but I suppose could download/build python 3.5 and use the same compiler for it.
2016-04-05 15:24:31	brcolow	what is that needed for?
2016-04-05 15:24:48	brcolow	(not sure what a "wheel" is) 
2016-04-05 15:25:04	bfredl	to build python binary packages
2016-04-05 15:25:19	brcolow	hm
2016-04-05 15:25:39	bfredl	It is basicaly a VS C++ compiler but already preconfigured with python2 dll/headers
2016-04-05 15:25:49	brcolow	and that is for compiling....what?
2016-04-05 15:25:50	bfredl	as I understand it
2016-04-05 15:26:00	bfredl	binary packages for python
2016-04-05 15:26:10	brcolow	no but I mean in neovim's context
2016-04-05 15:26:31	bfredl	to debug neovim's python-client on windows.
2016-04-05 15:26:57	bfredl	I might need to build some binary dependencies
2016-04-05 15:27:05	brcolow	okay, okay, I think I get it :)
