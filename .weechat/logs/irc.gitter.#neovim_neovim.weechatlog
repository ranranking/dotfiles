2016-03-26 18:11:29	HarmtH	Oops my bad, I accidentally tried jobsend(..,"^V^C") because I first tried embedding it into a mapping and then saw ^C appearing in the terminal without transmitting a signal.
2016-03-26 18:11:36	HarmtH	jobsend(.."^C") works :)

2016-03-26 19:32:57	akatrevorjay	Hey guys, I'm noticing major slowdowns in my NeoVim on *exit*
2016-03-26 19:33:01	akatrevorjay	How do I profile that?
2016-03-26 19:34:22	akatrevorjay	Also, is there a way to specify an exclusion list of remote plugins to not load? I have plugins that have submodules of the same rplugin and it's causing quite a few of them to be registered, all at different versions.

2016-03-26 19:39:41	Shougo	You should use lazy loading in plugin managers

2016-03-26 19:39:57	Shougo	> How do I profile that?
2016-03-26 19:40:07	Shougo	I think neovim waits the remote commands.
2016-03-26 19:40:17	Shougo	It should be improved though.
2016-03-26 19:41:46	Shougo	You should create the new issue for exit performance
2016-03-26 20:43:14	marvim	`wsdjeg` what is the omni plugin for rust?
2016-03-26 20:43:38	Shougo	https://github.com/racer-rust/vim-racer
2016-03-26 20:46:09	marvim	`wsdjeg` thanks ,
2016-03-26 20:46:24	marvim	`wsdjeg` I now need to instal racer
2016-03-26 21:00:22	Shougo	$ cargo install racer
2016-03-26 21:02:40	marvim	`wsdjeg` RUST_SRC_PATH environment variable must be set to point to the src directory of a rust checkout. E.g. "/home/foouser/src/rust/src"
2016-03-26 21:02:57	Shougo	Yes
2016-03-26 21:03:08	marvim	`wsdjeg` does it mean I need set an evn RUST_SRC_PATH to rust src?
2016-03-26 21:03:20	marvim	`wsdjeg` or the src of my project
2016-03-26 21:03:40	Shougo	You must  download rust source code.
2016-03-26 21:03:54	Shougo	And specify the path to $RUST_SRC_PATH
2016-03-26 21:04:27	Shougo	Example: `let $SRC_RUST_PATH = "~/src/rust"`
2016-03-26 21:04:44	marvim	`wsdjeg` but I install rust by pacman ,it is diff version from source.git
2016-03-26 22:20:19	marvim	`greister` how to make buffers clickable using airline?
2016-03-26 22:42:28	marvim	`wsdjeg` hi Shougo, must I install https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim,
2016-03-26 22:42:47	marvim	`wsdjeg` by default,vim do not detect rust file
2016-03-26 22:42:54	marvim	`shou12` Yes
2016-03-26 23:46:38	nathanaelkane	I can't seem to get `NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_CURSOR_SHAPE=1` working with iTerm2 (2.9.20160313), tmux (HEAD) and NeoVim (HEAD). It uses the correct insert cursor when using NeoVim *without* tmux.

2016-03-27 15:36:23	marvim	`shou12` @wsdjeg I cannot reproduce.
2016-03-27 15:36:45	marvim	`shou12` Please create new issue.
2016-03-27 15:36:59	marvim	`shou12` I will test it.
2016-03-27 15:38:58	marvim	`shou12` akatrevojay:Lazy loading works for me
2016-03-27 15:39:33	marvim	`shou12` I use dein.vim. I don't know other plugin managers.
